# basically what i did here created PORT 5000 to run the app 
# Database isn't created base on the instruction from Mark
# the DevOps guy can host the server side and edit the "proxy": "http//localhost5000" in package.json file in client directory to "proxy": "server_side_host_url"
# with that the frontend will be automatically linked with backend
